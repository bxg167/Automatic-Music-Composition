All of these midi files were created with the help of http://midi.mathewvp.com/midiSequencer.php
All midi files were created using this Sequencer. This Sequencer only creates Format 1 midi files, so I had to use another tool (http://gnmidi.com/gnmidfmten.htm) to convert them some of them into format 0 or format 2 (Which are needed for testing)
